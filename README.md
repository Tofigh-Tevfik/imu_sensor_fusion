# Orientation Estimation Filters on ESP32

This project implements and compares multiple **orientation estimation algorithms** on a **6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** using an **ESP32 microcontroller**. It demonstrates the practical performance, accuracy, and computational trade-offs of various filtering techniques for real-time orientation estimation on resource-constrained embedded systems.

## 🧭 Overview

The system uses a **3-axis accelerometer** and a **3-axis gyroscope** to estimate orientation. Raw IMU data is processed on the ESP32 using several sensor fusion algorithms, and the resulting orientation is transmitted via **UDP** to a host computer for visualization and analysis.

The following filters are implemented and compared:

- 🟢 **Low-Pass Filter** — simple, noise-tolerant but slow and inaccurate during fast motion  
- 🔵 **Complementary Filter** — lightweight, blends low- and high-frequency data from sensors  
- 🟣 **Madgwick Filter** — fast convergence, good noise robustness  
- 🟠 **Mahony Filter** — stable and responsive, suitable for real-time systems  
- 🔴 **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** — probabilistic optimal estimator, high accuracy, but computationally intensive
